# Quoridor!
Hello and thank you for trying out my software! Python3 is required to run!

Credit to the creators of the board game Quoridor @creators.
I have taken their concept and turned it into a fun terminal game for 2 players!

The concept of the game is simple. Get to your opponents side of the board before they
reach yours. You can move one space up, right, down, or left on your turn, OR
you can place a single wall between two grid spaces anywhere on the map. However you have a limited number of wall pieces you can place.
Be careful when placing your walls, what may seems like a good idea now may get in your way later!

To start playing simply open your terminal and navigate to wherever the file is located
(i.e. ../Documents/Quoridor) and then run "$python3 Game.py".

The software will then prompt Player 1 to enter a column number for their character to
start on, and Player 2 after that. Once starting positions have been chosen, the game begins!
On your turn you can either enter a movement command ('w','d','s','a') up, right, down, and
left respectively, or enter the coordinates of two grid spaces for a wall to be placed between. For example, if I would like to place a wall between the spaces located at (row 2, column 2) and and (row 2, column 3) I would type "2,2 2,3".
